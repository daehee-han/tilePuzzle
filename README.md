tilePuzzle
==========

tilePuzzle is a simple sliding tile puzzle jQuery Plugin. All you need to do is bind the plugin to an empty div, pass in a level (3+) and an image url and a tilePuzzle will be created.

A live demo is at:

Improvements Suggested Aug 2013
=========

- Use css animations to slide tiles, with JS fallback when no css transition support available
- Detect touch device and bind to tap not click where possible and possible ability to drag tiles
- Scramble tiles slower and possibly make into a nicer animation you see after puzzle initialized
